# network-topology-by-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
## project requirements:
### Using packet tracer, implement the following network topology and implement the following:
1.	Assign IP addresses to all PCs.  
2.	Assign IP addresses to all router interfaces following the criteria below.  
3.	Make sure each host can ping at least one other host in the same network.  
4.	Implement single area OSPF routing protocol for IPv4.  
5.	Show that IPv4 packets are correctly routed all over the network topology.  
6.	Assign IPv6 addresses all connected interfaces on routers (R0,R1,R5 and R6).  
7.	Implement single area OSPF routing protocol for IPv6.  
8.	Assume all other routers are not IPv6 capable, so, do not configure IPv6 on other router, then, implement a tunnel (IPv6 over IPv4) to allow IPv6 traffic to pass through those routers, show evidence of correct config.  
9.	From router R0 ping the IPv6 IP address of any interface on R6.  
10.	Ping from PC01 to PC61.  
11.	Ping from PC02 to PC62.  
12.	Ping from PC01 to PC62.
